Reference: The following program is from the CMPUT 275 course. 

A simple program to convert some .bmp files into the 565 .lcd format we use
in CMPUT 275. Most of this is from a comment in this forum thread:

https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=356479.0

It was modified to work with Python3 and to print out image statistics to a
separate .txt file.

Usage:
python3 bmp2lcd.py <image.bmp> <destination.lcd>

Where
 - image.bmp is the name of the .bmp file you wish to convert
 - destination.lcd is the name of the .lcd file you wish to create

This will also create a file destination.lcd.txt with some basic information
about the file including the width and height in pixels.

EXAMPLE:
The file FLAG_B24.bmp is included as an example.
Source: https://www.fileformat.info/format/bmp/sample/index.htm

Try:
python3 bmp2lcd.py FLAG_B24.bmp FLAG_B24.lcd

This will save the .lcd file as FLAG_B24.lcd and create another file
FLAG_B24.lcd.txt which indicates the width and height in pixels (both 124).

Then, just copy the .lcd fild itself to the root of the SD card and you can use
it! The width and height must be known when you use the lcd_image.h library
we used in class.

BMP Requirements:
The BMP should be in "RGB" or "RGBA" colour mode. If you are not sure if yours
is, try the tool anyway. If it does not work, the file you started with is either
not a .bmp file or is not in the correct colour mode. In the latter case, you can
probably find an online converter.
